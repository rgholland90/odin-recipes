    <p>
      Learn how to bake chicken that's tender, juicy, and perfect every time
      with this simple, 5-ingredient recipe for boneless, skinless chicken
      breasts. Adding just a bit of chicken broth to those beautiful pan
      drippings creates a tasty pan sauce that adds extra flavor at the table.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>
        1 pinch Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®), or more to taste
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chicken broth, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and
        Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until
        no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes
        more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read
        at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Remove chicken to a plate.</li>
      <li>
        Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the
        bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to
        dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.
      </li>
      <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
